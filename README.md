# YelpCamp
*The YelpCamp final project code of the Web Dev Bootcamp by Colt Steele on Udemy*

YelpCamp is a fullstack project made with the guidance of the WDB by Colt Steele on Udemy. YelpCamp is a full CRUD application with authentication
and authorization where users can signup, browse various campgrounds and view information on them, as well as post their own campgrounds and reviews. Users can
view various user posted reviews on the campground page. Users can navigate a large cluster map on the main index page
with all the posted grounds and view them individually by clicking on a node.

- **Node.js** and **Express** were used for the backend
- **EJS** was used alongside **Bootstrap** for rendering and styling the various views
- **MongoDB**, **Mongoose** and **MongoDB Atlas** were used to model the database and deploy it to a cloud cluster. 
- Various other technologies were used such as:
  - Cloudinary (for storing images)
  -  MapBox (for maps and geocoding)
  -  Passport (for authentication)
  -  Joi (for validation)
  -  Helmet (for security)
  among various others
